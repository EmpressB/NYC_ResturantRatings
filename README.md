# NYC Restaurant Ratings Insight Dashboard

This project analyzes New York City restaurant inspection data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights about restaurant performance across different boroughs and cuisines.

The goal is to provide an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore ratings, violations, and inspection outcomes throughout NYC.

## Project Overview
- **Dataset**: NYC Restaurant Inspection Results
- **Tools Used**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Borough-wise distribution of restaurant grades
  - Most common violations across NYC
  - Cuisine types with the highest and lowest inspection scores
  - Trends in restaurant ratings over time

## Key Insights
- Certain boroughs had a higher percentage of "A" grades compared to others.
- Some violation types were consistently more common citywide.
- Specific cuisine categories showed different risk profiles based on inspection results.

## Next Steps
- Develop an interactive Tableau or Power BI dashboard for dynamic exploration.
- Perform predictive modeling to identify factors most associated with poor inspection outcomes (Optional).
